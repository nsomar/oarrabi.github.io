Here is a simple UX to approval process that i summarised after
reading [this
article](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/09/11/sticky-menus-are-quicker-to-navigate/ "this article"),
i hope i got it right.

1.  *Collecting information about the problem*(Done by the UX):\
    Why, What, When, Where, How, and Who.

2.  *Getting ready to design*(Done by the UX):
    Using Lo-Fi (paper and whiteboard) or Hi-Fi (tools or software)
    methods to create a Wireframe.
    Then presenting the wire frames to stakeholders and product owners.
<!--more-->
3.  Design (Done by the UI or visual designer): 
    Refine the wire frames, design the interaction. and move it to the
    UI Visual designer. The UI Visual Designers create the Mockup.

4.  Optional prototyping (Done By UI and Developers):
    Create a prototype to show to thestakeholdersandproduct owners.

5.  Approval:
    Get the approval from the stakeholders and product owners on
    the Mockup or Wireframe (or the Prototype).

Thats is the simple crude process that was stated (or at least what i
grasped of) from the article above.

I would love to read your ideas about this article, any feedback will be
much appreciated.
