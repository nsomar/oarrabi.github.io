Bellow is a summerization of apple HIG.
I will divide HIG to multiple parts.
Following is part 1.

###Display Size

Regardless of the iOS device, the following observation apply:

- 44 X 44 points is the minimum acceptable size for a tappable area.
- People are aware of the quality of the app.
- app screen should be focused on content.

###Difference between pixels and points

- Pixel are used when designing the icon on an image application.
- Points are related to the representation of views and icons on the
iOS device

Notes

>1 Point = 1 Pixel (non retina device) 1 Point = 2 Pixel (retina device) 

###Devices Sizes (in Points)

Device Resolution 
iPhone 3G/3GS 320 X 480 points
iPhone 4/4S, iPod 4th 320 X 480 points
iPhone 5, iPod 5th 320 X 568 points
iPad 1/2 1024 X 768points
iPad 3/4 1024 X 768 points
iPad mini 1024 X 768 points

###Devices Sizes (in Pixels)

Device Resolution
iPhone 3G/3GS 320 X 480 pixels
iPhone 4/4S, iPod 4th 640 X 960 pixels
iPhone 5, iPod 5th 640 X 1136 pixels
iPad 1/2 1024 X 768 pixels
iPad 3/4 2048 X 1572 pixels
iPad mini 1024 X 768 pixels

###iOS devices and orientations

Launching an app on the iPad and the iPhone responds differently.

- on iPhone app launch as Portrait by default
- on the iPad apps launch as the current orientation of the device.

###Preferences and settings

There is a difference between **prefferences** and **settings**.

- **Preferences** are kept inside the application itself.
- **settings** are kept inside the settings app.

###Functional differences:

- **Preferences** deals with user settings, such as accounts,
notifications etc… (common).
- **settings** deals with app general and global settings (rare to be
used).

###App help should be minimal

Reasons:

- Tendency from users to disregard help
- Tendency from users to dislike help
- Help takes alot of space and time to be created
