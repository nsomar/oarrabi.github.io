###Desing Principles

Desing pinciple are focused on how users think and use an app and not
about wether the app design looks atractive. they tend to focus on app
usability vs design.

###Aesthetic Integrity

 This principle measures app to UI relation, as follows:
<!--more-->

- Productivity related apps must have a minimal UI, they must focus on
the task.
- Immersive task apps such as games, UI must be immersive and promises
fun.

###Consistency

App must be consistent, with other apps, and other versions of the same
app, the consistency will give users the confidence to use the app
seamlessly.

###Note:
Using well established UX Design patterns help users grasp
your app instantly.


 A point that i would like to state here, is that UI Designers seem to
have problems following well established patterns based on an idea that
design patterns bound their ideas. what i think is, the idea of creating
ingenious UIs is contradictory to a well known desing principle “dont
make the user think about the UI”

A well Designed UI must fade away leaving only the content visible for
the user to focus on.

###Direct Manipulation

 Direct manipulation of on screen objects help user understand your app
more quicly.

 When you have a choice in your app of directly manipulate an object or
use on screen controls, always choose the first option.

###Feedback

 The app must give user feedback on their actions in several ways:

- Buttons must have a highlight state to inform the user that it has
been tapped
- List become higlighted when user taps them
- Long processes and operations must present a progress view or an
indicator.

###Metaphore

Metaphores help users understand the app usability faster than abstract
interfaces. Methapores should be used whenever possible, just be warry
of not stretching them too far.

###User Control

App should be designed to give user as much control as is possible,
giving users the ability to cancel or stop operations that are ongoing
is preferable.
