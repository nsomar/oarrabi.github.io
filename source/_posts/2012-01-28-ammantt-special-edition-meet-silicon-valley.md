It was good being at AmmanTT special edition today, amazing speakers and
nice ambient.

The top comment or idea that i liked is that “ideas dont matter,
execution is what matters” The speak was good, even so, the answer where
vague and general.

<!--more-->

So i think that this is normal, achieving success is not a deterministic
process, there is no 1 correct path that can be followed to achieve
that.

So i think that basically in order to success in something, one should
try a lot of times, even if he fails a couple of times, the momentum
will (hopefully) push him to success and achieve good market
penetration.

In the end an idea is nothing without good (or as some of the speakers
stated it ‘perfect’) executions.
